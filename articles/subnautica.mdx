# Introduction

Subnautica is an underwater survival game that takes place on an alien planet.
Developed by Unknown Worlds Entertainment and released in 2018, the game has received critical acclaim for its intriguing story, exceptional world design, immersive gameplaya and stunning music / sound effects.  

In Subnautica, players take on the role of "Ryley Robinson", a lone survivor of a spaceship crash on an alien planet covered almost entirely in water.

# Story
The game's opening cutscene is disorienting and intense, as Ryley must quickly scramble to an escape pod to escape a crashing spaceship called the Aurora.
Just as Ryley embarks on a life pod and initiates the launch, a fire hydrant comes loose from its holder and starts sporadically bouncing from wall to wall;
this causes one of the side panels to also come loose. It flies around until it eventually hits Ryley in the face, knocking them unconscious.

Hours later, Ryley is slowly awakened by a blaring alarm;
we soon realise that the pod is on fire!
They stumble out of their seat and quickly grab the fire extinguisher,
and put the fire out. The pod is now safe, but the fire has caused some damage to the pod's systems.
Ryley activates their PDA (personal digital assistant) to discover that almost all their data has been corrupted. They'll need to scan creatures, fauna, and fragments of technology to regain the data.
The PDA also tells them that the outside world has a harmless atmosphere and it's safe to go outside.
They take a deep breath and climbs the ladder to the hatch. In front of them lie the remains of the desolate Aurora.
