Oneshot is a game that has gained popularity over the past few years, and it's easy to see why.
This game is a unique and engaging experience that will keep you hooked from start to finish.

The premise of Oneshot is simple: you play as a young child named Niko who awakens in a strange world with no memory of how you got there.
As you explore this world, you'll uncover clues and solve puzzles to help you progress through the story and save the world from destruction.

What sets Oneshot apart from other games is its use of metafictional elements.
Throughout the game, you'll interact with characters who are aware of your presence,
and they'll speak directly to you (the player) in ways that break the fourth wall.
This creates a sense of immersion that is rarely seen in other games,
and it's one of the reasons why Oneshot has gained such a loyal following.

Another standout feature of Oneshot is its art style.
The game is presented in a pixelated, retro style but needs to be more complex and essential.
The environment's attention to detail is impressive, and the character designs are charming and memorable.
The music is also a highlight of Oneshot. The haunting and atmospheric soundtrack perfectly complements the game's mysterious and otherworldly atmosphere.

One of the things that impressed me most about Oneshot is how it manages to tell a compelling story without relying on exposition or lengthy cutscenes.
Instead, the story is told through the environment, the characters, and the puzzles you solve.
This approach allows players to feel like they're actively participating in the story rather than just watching it unfold.

The puzzles in Oneshot are challenging but fair, and they require you to think outside the box (literally) and use your problem-solving skills to progress.
However, the game never feels frustrating or unfair, and there's always a sense of satisfaction when you finally figure out a particularly tricky puzzle.

One of the only downsides to Oneshot is that it's a relatively short game.
Depending on how quickly you solve puzzles, you can finish the game in 4-5 hours.
However, the game's quality more than makes up for its brevity, and it's an experience I highly recommend to anyone.

Overall, Oneshot is a beautifully crafted game that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who plays it.
Its use of metafictional elements, captivating story, and unique art style makes it a standout title in the indie game scene.
Suppose you're looking for a game that will mentally and emotionally challenge you and leave you thinking about it long after you've finished playing.
In that case, Oneshot is worth checking out.
