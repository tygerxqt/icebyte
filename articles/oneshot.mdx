# Story
Oneshot is an adventure game that puts players in the shoes of a cat-like creature named Niko, who must save the dying world they find themselves in. The game's story is a captivating tale of sacrifice and determination, as Niko must navigate through a strange and hostile world to restore the sun, which has gone dark.

The game's narrative is driven by engaging characters and player engagement, with Niko being the main protagonist that players control throughout the game. Niko is a curious and compassionate character willing to do whatever it takes to save the world, even if it means putting themselves in danger.

Players will encounter characters who help or hinder their progress throughout the game, each with unique personalities and motivations. The mysterious Entity, The Author, guides Niko on their journey and serves as a mentor and advisor. There is also the enigmatic Entity, a shadowy figure who seems to pull the strings behind the scenes.

As players progress through the game, they will uncover more about the world of Oneshot and the forces at play. The game's story is a masterpiece of storytelling that draws players into its world from the beginning, with its beautiful graphics, haunting soundtrack, and intriguing storyline.

One of the most unique aspects of Oneshot's story is how it engages with the player outside of the game itself. As players progress through the game, they encounter puzzles and challenges that require them to act outside the game, such as manipulating files on their computers or taking note of their wallpaper that the game frequently changes.

The story of Oneshot is a unique and emotional experience that will stay with players long after finishing the game. It is a testament to the power of storytelling in video games and showcases the potential for games to be more than just mindless entertainment.

# World
The game's level design is outstanding, with each level being meticulously crafted to provide players with a challenging yet enjoyable experience. The puzzles are thought-provoking and require players to think outside the box to progress through the game.

The world-building in Oneshot is also something to behold. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, where the player plays the role of a young child who must save the world, that they have been mysteriously transported to, from destruction. The world is beautifully designed, with each area's unique atmosphere and aesthetic. The attention to detail in the game is truly remarkable, with even the smallest of components contributing to the overall immersion of the game. 

The game's world is split up into 3 different areas, the Barrens, the Glen, and the Refuge. 

The barren atmosphere is sad, gloomy, and dead. Nothing organic lives here, only robots. Most of the robots are dead as the main generator stopped a long time ago.

The Glen is full of organic lifeforms; they do not have electricity as it is filled with water with little islands that the residents live on. It is a very rural area and the atmosphere here is peaceful and welcoming.

Finally, the Refuge is the most advanced area, they have electricity, modern technology, and a science lab. This is where the game closes and Niko (the protagonist) returns home. Atmosphere is created to be melancholy and depressing due to scientists trying to save this dying world, but also quite hostile due to the scale of the buildings and colour of the world.

The atmosphere created makes the audience feel terrible for the situation that the world is in, Niko is in and that you (the player) handle the final choice. The entire time we were told that we would be able to return the sun and Niko could go home. However, we are revealed to not be accurate. It is worse than Niko being just a child, taken away from her family; they aren't even from this world! The final choice is the worst thing this game has thrown at the audience. Initially, we were told we only had "oneshot", hence the game's name, so we couldn't choose both. Either way, you have OneShot to save the world and trap Niko there forever, or let it perish, and Niko goes home. The choice is yours. 

# Gameplay
Oneshot is famous for using "fourth wall breaking" as a game mechanic; the game is aware that you are in control and uses that to its advantage. In an interview with PC Gamer, Velasquez (Lead Developer) said, "Psycho Mantis and Metal Gear Solid inspired the fourth wall-breaking-breaking nature of OneShot." She said that this concept of a "meta game" came first, with its story being based on it.  

The fourth-wall-breaking elements of the game make the user solve some puzzles, requiring them to search through their computer for files that hold codes and hints. Niko doesn't know that and points it out when you type a password for something, but she hasn't seen a code anywhere. This creates an aura of guilt as we can't directly talk to Niko, and the player feels bad for confusing them even more. Alternatively, it could be humorous as Niko is oblivious to what is happening and plays along.

The puzzles in Oneshot are challenging but always feel fair. They often require you to think outside the box and use your creativity to progress. The game also features a morality system that tracks your choices throughout the story. These choices have consequences and can affect the ending you receive.

# Music and Sound effects
The music and sound effects in the game are equally noteworthy. The game's hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is composed of ambient sounds and atmospheric music that perfectly complement the game's pixel art style.

The sound effects are also done exceptionally well, providing players with an immersive experience that brings the game's world to life. From the sound of Niko's footsteps to the eerie ambience of the game's more mysterious areas, the sound design in Oneshot is nothing short of exceptional. It truly adds to the game's overall experience and is sure to captivate players from start to finish.



# Conclusion
Overall, Oneshot is a truly fantastic game that is well worth playing. Its emotional depth and innovative gameplay mechanics make it a standout title in the gaming world. Whether you are a fan of puzzle games or appreciate a good story, Oneshot will leave a lasting impression.
